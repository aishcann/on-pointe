# Major Hurdles

The biggest hurdle in the project was styling. In particular, keeping text contained within the divs and having all elements stay inline on the page.

Another hurdle was the progress bar. I had to learn how to create one and get it to progress (or regress) with each question. I aggregated information from the following links to create the one present in the game: [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjhsS4lNZ9o&t=610s) and [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-4tg5snUuw&t=422s)

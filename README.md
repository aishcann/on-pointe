# User Stories

1. As a player, I want to know if my answers are right or wrong, so I know how well I'm doing in the game.

1. As a player, I want to be able to see how many questions are in the trivia game, so I know how long or short the game I'm playing is, and where I'm progressing through that.
1. As a player, I want a visual cue as to how many questions I got right vs how many I got wrong, so I can understand how well I am doing.
1. As a player, I want to have a game that is visually pleasing, so that it incentivizes me to continue using the game.

# Major Hurdles

The biggest hurdle in the project was styling. In particular, keeping text contained within the divs and having all elements stay inline on the page.

Another hurdle was the progress bar. I had to learn how to create one and get it to progress (or regress) with each question. I aggregated information from the following links to create the one present in the game: [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjhsS4lNZ9o&t=610s) and [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-4tg5snUuw&t=422s)

# Unsolved Problems

Continuing with styling, in my deployed site, my progress bar keeps moving from being in line with the rest of the body, to the left of the game.  This does not happen when I work with the game in VSCode.  I'm still figuring out what is happening here.
